    Hello, My name is Mert. I'm 27 years old. I started my software adventure
    for the last 1 year. Since I couldn't make the right decisions in my 20s,
    I chose the wrong professions. Then I went to the mirror and asked myself.
    What do you want? Ever since I was a child, I was too busy with
    technology. That's when I asked myself. What can I do about technology and
    what can I offer people? After this question, I decided to enter the
    software industry. For the last year, I have been developing myself on web
    coding.
